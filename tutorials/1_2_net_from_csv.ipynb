    "It has been demonstrated in previous tutorials how a pandapipes net can be created step-by-step by creating each component individually with its respective `create...` function.\n",
    "In many cases however, pandapipes will be integrated into a tool chain. For larger studies, grid data will likely be downloaded from somewhere, exported from other tools or might be received from another party. One established format for these exchanges is the [.csv-file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial guides through the creation of a pandapipes net while taking example .csv-files as input.\n",
    "To make the process more convenient and efficient, _plural_ create functions (e.g. create_junctions) are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .csv files specifying the network are loaded from the \"files/example_gas_net_csvs\" folder which is located in the same folder as this notebook. They determine the [components](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html) of the example network used to illustrate this tutorial(see picture below): the junctions (i.e. nodes), the pipes, the external grids and the sinks.\n",
