    "This example demonstrates how to model and analyze a simple district heating network with a circular flow using pandapipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network consists of a pump (representing a heat generator) that supplies hot water, which flows through consumers (heat exchangers), releases heat, and then returns to the pump. In addition to pressure and velocity distribution, the temperature profile throughout the network is also calculated. Due to heat losses and heat extraction by the consumer, the temperature will decrease along the flow path. Understanding these temperature drops is crucial for energy efficiency and proper system design in district heating networks.\n",
