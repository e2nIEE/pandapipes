    "# Time Series in a Circular District Heating Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to perform a time series simulation for a district heating network using pandapipes. It builds upon the simple circular district heating grid described in the notebook 'circular_flow_in_a_district_heating_grid.ipynb'.\n",

    "In real-world district heating systems, the heat demand and operating conditions change over time. Time series simulations allow you to analyze the dynamic behavior of the network, such as how temperature, pressure, and flow rates evolve in response to varying consumer demands or external conditions.\n",

    "In this notebook, you will learn:\n",

    "- How to set up a district heating network for time series analysis with pandapipes.\n",
    "- How to define time-dependent input data (e.g., heat demand profiles).\n",
    "- How to run a time series simulation and log relevant results.\n",
    "- How to visualize and interpret the results over multiple time steps.\n",
