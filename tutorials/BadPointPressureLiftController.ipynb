    "## BadPointPressureLiftController: Pressure Control at the Worst Point\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BadPointPressureLiftController` is a custom controller designed for district heating networks modeled with pandapipes. Its main purpose is to maintain a minimum pressure difference at the network's \"worst point\"—the heat exchanger with the lowest pressure difference (Schlechtpunktregelung).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Worst Point Detection:** Identifies the heat exchanger with the lowest pressure difference where heat flow is present.\n",
    "- **Pressure Regulation:** Adjusts the circulation pump's lift and flow pressures to ensure the pressure difference at the worst point meets a specified minimum target.\n",
    "- **Proportional Control:** Uses a proportional gain to determine the adjustment magnitude based on the deviation from the target pressure difference.\n",
    "- **Standby Mode:** If no heat flow is detected, the controller switches the pump to a standby mode with minimum lift and flow pressures.\n",
    "- **Convergence Check:** Determines if the pressure difference is within a specified tolerance of the target, signaling convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:** The controller is initialized with the network, pump index, target pressure difference, tolerance, proportional gain, and minimum pressure settings.\n",
    "- **Integration:** It can be integrated into a simulation loop, automatically adjusting pump pressures at each time step to maintain optimal network operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This controller is particularly useful for ensuring reliable and efficient operation in district heating systems, where maintaining a minimum pressure difference at the most critical point is essential for system stability and performance."

    "## Example Usage of the BadPointPressureLiftController\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the usage of the `BadPointPressureLiftController`, we provide an example with a simple test network. The network is initialized using a `initialize_test_net` function, which sets up a district heating system with two heat consumers, a circulation pump, and several pipes and junctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller is instantiated and added to the network as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "net = initialize_test_net()\n",
    "\n",
    "dp_controller = BadPointPressureLiftController(net)\n",
    "net.controller.loc[len(net.controller)] = [dp_controller, True, -1, -1, False, False]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function performs the following steps:\n",
    "- Creates a pandapipes network with water as the working fluid.\n",
    "- Adds junctions for the pump, pipes, and heat exchangers.\n",
    "- Installs a circulation pump with specified flow and lift pressures.\n",
    "- Adds two heat consumers with configurable heat extraction and return temperatures.\n",
    "- Connects all components with pipes.\n",
    "- Runs an initial pipeflow calculation.\n",
    "- Instantiates the `BadPointPressureLiftController` and registers it in the network's controller table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the network is initialized, the controller will automatically regulate the pump pressures during simulation to maintain the minimum pressure difference at the worst point (the heat exchanger with the lowest pressure difference). This ensures reliable operation and helps prevent under-supply at critical points in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my implementation, a dp_min of 1 bar is used in the Controller."
