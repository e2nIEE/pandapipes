    "There are several aspects to consider when constructing a heating network. To get a basic introduction to creating a pandapipes network, please see the tutorial [\"Creating pandapipes Networks\"](https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapipes/blob/master/tutorials/creating_a_simple_network.ipynb) first. For the pipes, additional parameters must be specified: The heat transfer coefficient (*alpha_w_per_m2k*), which determines how well or poorly the pipe insulates and the number of internal pipe sections (*sections*). Likewise the ambient temperature of the pipe (*text_k*) can be changed, which is 293 K by default. In this case the variable *ambient_temperature* in the [*pipeflow* function](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pipeflow.html) should be set to the same value. In addition, for an external grid the variable *type* should be set to \"pt\" or \"t\" and a constant temperature value for *t_k* should be defined. Furthermore, start values for the temperatures at the junctions (*tfluid_k*) should be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that only incompressible media can be used for the heating network calculation and the [*mode*](https://pandapipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pipeflow/calculation_modes.html#temperature-calculations-pipeflow-option-mode-all-or-mode-heat) in the *pipeflow* function has to be set to \"all\" or \"heat\". In case *mode* equals \"heat\", the user must manually specify a solution vector for the hydraulic calculations. It should also be noted that the temperature calculations are currently still sequential. This means that the calculated temperature values do not influence the hydraulic properties of the medium. Therefore, the calculations are only valid if the properties are not very temperature-dependent or if there are minor changes in temperature.\n",
