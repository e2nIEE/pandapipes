About pandapipes
################

pandapipes is a piping grid simulation tool based on pandapower. It uses `pandas tables <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_.
for the input and output data representation and implements a Newton-Raphson solver for steady-state
analysis, in analogy to `pandapower <www.pandapower.org>`_ and aims at a similar level of automation
for the analysis and optimization of piping grids.
