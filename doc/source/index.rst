pandapipes is an easy to use network calculation program aimed at automation of analysis of district heating
and gas systems. It utilizes the data analysis library pandas and is also closely related to
the power systems calculation program pandapower.

pandapipes and pandapower can be used in combination to analyze multi energy networks. An environment able to couple both
tools is pandapower-Pro.
